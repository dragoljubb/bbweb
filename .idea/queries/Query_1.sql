VALUES ('Stats review: Explaining Barcelona and Valencia''s rise in the standings',
        'Sportradar''s Matt Kamalsky examines the defensive improvements that have vaulted Barcelona and Valencia to top-three spots in the standings',
        'There was significant movement at the top of the EuroLeague standings following Round 15 as Valencia Basket and FC Barcelona jumped into the top three, joining Hapoel IBI Tel Aviv to form the trio of teams with at least 10 wins thus far.  That is no small feat for a pair of teams that started the season 2-3 and 3-3, respectively, before rattling off impressive strings of performances that now put them in striking distance of first-place heading into the final two-round week of 2025.'
        'For FC Barcelona, the change that has sparked its recent success is pretty specific.  With its offense performing at a top-10 level even as it had a couple players in and out of the lineup in the early going, much of its growth has come defensively, hinging almost entirely on a change in approach at guarding pick-and-rolls.
On the surface, Barcelona has gone from allowing 1.07 points per possession over its first six games to only 0.97 per possession over its last nine. That is roughly the equivalent of jumping from 20th to fourth in defensive efficiency. Digging a little deeper, the choices that have supported that improvement are pretty clear. After giving opposing ball handlers quite a bit of latitude in the early going, Barcelona is facing 5 fewer possessions from opposing guards in the pick-and-roll per game — getting over screens more consistently and often just doing a better job of forcing opposing guards to give up the ball, whether hedging or switching.  Similarly, rotating early to limit scoring opportunities for opposing screeners — especially on pops to the perimeter, Barcelona has loaded up to stop two-man actions.  Even if it is facing more jumpers when the ball is sprayed out to the wings, it has contested looks within pick-and-rolls and deflected enough passes with its rotations to more than compensate.'
